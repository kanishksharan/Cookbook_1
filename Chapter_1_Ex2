Problem
You need to unpack N elements from an iterable, but the iterable may be longer than N
elements, causing a “too many values to unpack” exception.
'''
'''
suppose you have user records that consist of a name and email
address, followed by an arbitrary number of phone numbers. You could unpack the
records like this:
'''
user_record = ('Dave', 'dave@example.com', '773-555-1212', '847-555-1212')
name, email, *phone_numbers = user_record # phone_numbers is the "starred" assignment that can take multiple values as a List.
print(name)
# Output = 'Dave'
print(email)
# Output = 'dave@example.com'
print(phone_numbers)
# Output = ['773-555-1212', '847-555-1212']

'''
It’s worth noting that the phone_numbers variable will always be a list, regardless of how
many phone numbers are unpacked (including none).
